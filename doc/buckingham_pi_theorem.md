Suppose we have a physically meaningful equation such as:

f(q1,....qn) = 0

where the qi are n physical variables, and they are expressed in terms of k independent physical units.

Then it can be rephrased as:

F(p1,.....pm) = 0

where the pi are dimensionless parameters construted from the qi by p = n - m dimensionless equations--the so-called Pi groups -- of the form :

pi = q1^a1 * q2^a2 * .... * qn ^ an

where the exponents ai are rational numbers (indeed by redefining pi as being raised to the apropos power to clear the denominator)

Proof:


Consider a funny vector space.

It is a vector space over the rational numbers.

Multiplication of physical units is the vector addition.
Raising to powers is the scalar multiplication operation.

E.g. the gravity has the units of D/T^2  (distance over time squared)

Take the basis vectors ad D and T.  Then corresponding vector would be (1, -2)

1.  take the qi.....qn and form the _dimensional matrix_ M:
    one row for every basis unit, and the ith column is the
    corresponding vector for the units qi.

2.  Well then if [a1,......an]T is the ith column, then
    pi = q1^a1 * ....* qn^an

3.  The matrix can only have k linearly independent dimensions.  Since k = n-m and m<=n,
    t
