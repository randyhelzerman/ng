# Geometric Algebra

Here's one way to think about gemetric algebra.  We've found the
notion of a vector space to be quite a good abstraction.

Yet when you sit down and write out the axioms to define
a vector space, you find them full of annoying ad hoc
special cases:

1.  There's two different sorts of things, scalars and vectors.
    There's no term for the whole lot of them.

2.  You can divide a vector by a scalar, but you can't divide a vector
    by a vector.

3.  When defining addition, you have to have two sets of axioms, one
    for vectors, and one for scalars, because you can't add scalars
    and vectors.

I'll try to keep it as abstract as possible.  Instead of
starting out with gemetric algebra, lets call it
the concept of a "multivector space."
